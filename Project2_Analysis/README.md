# Introduction
Following the [salary dashboard](https://github.com/mchenliu/Excel_Project_Data_Job_Analysis/tree/main/Project1_Salary_Dashboard) from project one, this project dives further into the job posting data and analyze the relationship betwee skills required and salary for data science roles.

## Questions to Analyze
The questions I wanted to answer through my project are:

1. Do more skills get better pay?
2. What’s the salary for data jobs in different countries?
3. What are the top skills of data professionals?
4. What’s the pay for the top 10 skills?
   
## Excel Skills Used

I utilized these Excel for analysis:
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Power Query
- Power Pivot
- DAX (Data Analysis Expression)
